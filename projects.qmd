## Arctic Shrubs
My current PhD research is a cool project about shrubification in the Arctic and soil biogeochemical responses to shrub expansion. 

## Berries
I love berries and berry science! I am working on an interdisciplinary collaboration with UNH CARPE on a project examining berry vulnerability in northern Alaska.
